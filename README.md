# Image-Compression
Compress your pictures without actually worrying about the quality. 

If a lot of your images are in the MB range then you'll definitely want to use something like the script below to compress and essentially re-size these images in bulk. This assumes that the files are in a local directory on your computer and it will resize and save them with the exact same names there.

It will overwrite the existing files, you may tweek it according to your need. It will add a post-fix at the end of compressed file so that you may not compress an already compressed image.
